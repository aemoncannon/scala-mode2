## scala-mode2

### Overview

The current scala-mode is a bit buggy. The highlighting is haphazard and not
very thorough. The indenting support is so-so. There haven't been any
improvements in a long time.

scala-mode2 aims to change this.

The mode is currently testable, but will probably not replace scala-mode in
your day-to-day coding (yet!).

### Improvements

  1. Method highlighting is more reliable (no more annoying flickering)
  2. Symbols
  3. Better highlighting for types
  4. Reliable class/trait/object highlighting
  5. More flexible supported names for methods, types, etc.

### TODO

  1. improve "syntactic" highlighting junk (i.e. triple-quoted strings)
  2. indentation support
  3. Better comment support (e.g. multi-line /* ... */)
  4. support for which-function mode
  5. xml literals? (ugh!)
  6. ???
